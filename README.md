# Hi, I'm Jordan 

I'm a Data Science graduate with a strong interest in **machine learning**, **model design**, and **practical problem-solving**.  
I enjoy building clean, structured ML projects, exploring how models learn, and continually improving my understanding of the field.

Alongside machine learning, I'm also developing a **pixel-art sci-fi exploration game**, combining world-building, storytelling, and system design.

This GitHub profile is where I'm building my **machine learning portfolio**, one polished project at a time.

---

## What I'm Focused On

- Building practical ML notebooks for my portfolio  
- Improving my modelling foundations (classification, regression, clustering, NLP)  
- Developing clean, readable Python code  
- Exploring end-to-end workflows: data → model → evaluation → interpretation  
- Learning tools like Git, VS Code, and good development practices  
- Long-term: becoming a strong Machine Learning Engineer

---

## Skills & Tools

- **Languages:** Python  
- **ML / Data:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Techniques:** binary classification, regression, feature engineering, evaluation metrics, ROC analysis, model comparison  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub  
- **Other interests:** pixel art, game design, worldbuilding, narrative design

## Current Projects

- **VPN Traffic Classification** — deep learning binary classifier using TensorFlow  
- Expanding the portfolio with new ML notebooks (sentiment analysis, regression, clustering, etc.)  
- Developing systems and world mechanics for my pixel-art sci-fi game

---

## What I'm Learning Next

- Better development workflow using Git/GitHub  
- How to structure larger ML codebases  
- Model explainability (SHAP, LIME)  
- More advanced neural network architecture experiments  
- Improving my Unity/C# and pixel-art pipelines for game development
